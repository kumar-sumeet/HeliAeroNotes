    "Fluid cannot penetrate the surface of the body in consideration. This seems like a trivial concept to state explicitly but remember that when a problem involving fluids is mathematically stated, the condition at the boundaries of the fluid need to be clearl defined. In the case of an airfoil moving about it *infinite* fluid, the surface of the airfoil forms one of the boundaries (the other boundary is at infinite distance away and not a source of any discturbance). What happens to the fluid at this boundary, i.e. the surface of the airfoil, dictates what happens in the rest of the fluid. This behavior of the fluid, specifically the velocity in the case of an incompressible flow, is the quantity of interest because this would then eventually lead to the amount of lift generated from the subsequent behavior of the fluid due to the airfoil motion. Since we know from physical observations that fluid parcels do not permeate through object surfaces, the motion of the fluid at this boundary is exactly matched with the motion of the airfoil surface. This is refered to as the no penetration boundary condition."
