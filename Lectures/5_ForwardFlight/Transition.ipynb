    "As the helicopter moves from a hover flight state to a forward flight state, the rotor wake undergoes quite a bit of transformation so much so that the momentum theory approximations incur significant error making them inapplicable. Momentum theory again becomes applicable as higher forward flight speeds are attained. This *special* forward flight region 0< ${\\mu}$ <0.1 is generally referred to as the transition region where due to the proximity of the rotor tip vortices to the following blades leads to impulsive loadings, which in turn results in high noise and vibrations. Needless to say transition region is not comfortable for people inside the helicopter or for those in the neighbourhood it is flying over."

    "This is not a trivial question to ask. From basic understanding of airfoil aerodynamics, it is relatively obvious that to achieve hover at a given MTOW, the rotor collective needs to be increased until the helicopter leaves the ground. Once in hover, the main rotor thrust needs to be tilted so that a component of the rotor thrust accelerates the helicopter until enough parasite drag builds up to counter it."
