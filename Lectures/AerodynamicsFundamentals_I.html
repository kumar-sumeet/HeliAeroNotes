<p>Understanding the nature of forces acting on bodies of arbitrary shape is in our interest if the objective is to minimise the amount of work done in order to overcome the resistive forces due to friction caused due to relative motion between the body and the surrounding fluid. Optimum hull design of a cruise ship, minimum drag profile of a competitive road cyclist+cycle, â¦ are a few examples where an understanding of fluid behavior would help achieve the objectives. Of course, we need not look too far for examples because a helicopter has various entities that might benefit from design based on a sound knowhow in fluid dynamics. A â¦ fuselage design such that drag (rotorcraft fuselage drag is referred to as parasite drag) is minimised would go a long way in reducing operating costs.</p>

<h2>Navier-Stokes equations (NSE)<a class="headerlink" href="#navier-stokes-equations-nse" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The NSE are essential to so many analyses you encounter involving fluid flows yet they can be solved without the use of a computer for only a handful of idealised scenarios. Even today, the fact that these equations are challenging to solve is what keeps many aerospace and mechanical engineers employed. Which is why in the early days of the invention of the airplane, and essentially the beginning of the field of aerodynamics, the exact mathematical theory to analyse the flow already existed (NSE had already been around for atleast half a century by the time of the first Wright brothersâ flight) but was of little help since the equations couldnât be solved! Clever simplifications had to be devised based on meticulous experimental observations and astute engineering judgement so that the mathematical problem of lift generation could be posed in a way that it was atleast solvable, while of course simultaneously leading to results of acceptable accuracy. The schematic below shows the simplifications that are often adopted in fluid analyses based on the problem at hand.</p>

    <p  style="font-size:16px; color:gray; text-align:center;"> Fluid models and equations with different approximations  </p>
</center><p>The assumptions that lead to simplifications are the following-</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>no viscosity</p></li>
</ul>
<p>given the low kinematic viscosity of air, the viscous terms can be assumed to be much smaller than the other terms in certain scenarios leading to the Euler equation. However, even the Euler equation can be solved analytically.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>incompressibility</p></li>
</ul>
<p>assuming that the air in incompressible registers an error in the density of only about 3% for flow velocity upto Mach number 0.3. Clearly, for low speed applications this assumption is a reasonable one.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>irrotationality</p></li>
</ul>
<p>the influence of this assumption is mathematically very apparent in that it leads to the fluid flow behavior to be represented using the Laplaceâs equation. Which is an incredible simplification because of the properties that the function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span>, that statisfies the Laplace equation, is bound to exhibit. This is a linear equation which means it is amenable to superposition - i.e. flowfield around two bodies placed close to each other is the sum of the flow fields of the two bodies separately. The function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> is continuous and differentiable (referred to as holomorphic in mathematical parlance) which means any differentiable function represents the flow over some body. We just need to identify the function that represents the flowfield over the body of interest to us - an airfoil or a flat plate (airfoil with zero thickness). Lastly, the ubiquity with which this function appears in different areas of physics - electrostatics, gravitation etc. - means that aerodynamiscists would not be alone in their struggle to identify solution strategies for the Laplaceâs equation.</p>

<h2>Simple governing laws, complex results<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-governing-laws-complex-results" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The NSE are generally all that an aerospace engineer needs for all their aerodynamics analyses needs - five field partial differential equations and three constitutive relations to solve for three space coordinates (Lagrangian)/velocity components (Eulerian), pressure, density, temperature, viscosity and thermal conductivity. fuselage <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#rotorwake" id="id4">1</a> Being field equations, the NSE can be solved if the boundary conditions of the domain of investigation are known. In case of boundaries that form the interface with another material - for e.g. the surface of a wing - additional conditions need to be imposed since NSE do not cover the physics at such interfaces. Examples include âno slipâ boundary condition typically employed for flow over solid boundaries and âno temperature jumpâ in case of a temperature differential.</p>
<p>Since the momentum conservation equations are part of the NSE, Newtonâs 2nd is definitely involved when describing flow behavior. However, simply attributing lift generated by an airfoil, for e.g., to just Newtonâs 2nd law is not entirely accurate. There is an obvious cause and effect relation when one talks about Newtonâs 2nd law. Within a fluid, however, the motion of continuum parcels is influenced by the forces exerted and the forces exerted are in turn influenced by the motion of these parcels. For e.g., the momentum equation above can be viewed as a form of Newtonâs second law of motion F=mass x acceleration, except that the forcing terms on the RHS of the equation - the pressure gradient and the shear stresses - are themselves a function of the fluid velocity. The complex interaction between the three sets of forces - inertial, pressure and shear - is what gives fluid dynamics its richness.</p>
<p>Such implicit relations of relatively simple local physics (conservation laws) buried within the NSE make an intuitive foresight of what would happen in the global flowfield difficult. Below is an informal discussion of the mechanism by which airfoils generate lift to exemplify this.</p>

<p>If the picture on the left above is assumed to be the <em>true</em> fluid model, then it is easy to see that the lift generated would be proportional to square of the angle of attack. However, we now know that airfoil lift is proportional to angle of attack (at least when the flow is not significantly separated). This is also evident from the pressure contours around an airfoil shown below - doubling the anlge of attack doubles the pressure difference, the amount of fluid influenced stays the same.</p>

<p>Notice that viscosity did not come up in explanation above. Viscosity plays a key role in the ability of airfoil sections to produce lift in that it ensures that the fluid doesnât turn around the trailing edge. However, it is not necessary in order to quantify the amount of lift which is why simple potential flow theory models, such as thin airfoil theory, are capable to predicting airfoil lift to a good degree of accuracy. Even when the flow conditions are unsteady, potential flow theory-based unsteady models are just as capable in predicting the unsteady lift and moment variation.</p>

<p>The above, seemingly dissociated, set of concepts are nothing new and have been covered at length in fundamental fluid dynamics courses. These would be revisited when we build the framework for unsteady aerodynamics analyses.</p>

<dd><p>When modelling rotor wake there is not much to be gained from solving the most complex form of the problem. For e.g., most rotorcraft (atleast conventional designs) donât fly faster than M=0.3 so right away density can be assumed to be constant without incurring much error. So can temperature and viscosity, and thermal conductivity is just zero. From the continuity and the momentum conservation equations, the problem then boils down to solving for the three velocity components and the pressure distribution. More on that later.</p>
