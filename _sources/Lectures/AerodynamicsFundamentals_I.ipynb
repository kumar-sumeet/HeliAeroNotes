    "Since the momentum conservation equations are part of the NSE, Newton's 2nd is definitely involved when describing flow behavior. However, simply attributing lift generated by an airfoil, for e.g., to just Newton's 2nd law is not entirely accurate. There is an obvious cause and effect relation when one talks about Newton's 2nd law. Within a fluid, however, the motion of continuum parcels is influenced by the forces exerted and the forces exerted are in turn influenced by the motion of these parcels. For e.g., the momentum equation above can be viewed as a form of Newton's second law of motion F=mass x acceleration, except that the forcing terms on the RHS of the equation - the pressure gradient and the shear stresses - are themselves a function of the fluid velocity. The complex interaction between the three sets of forces - inertial, pressure and shear - is what gives fluid dynamics its richness.\n",

    "[^RotorWake]: When modelling rotor wake there is not much to be gained from solving the most complex form of the problem. For e.g., most rotorcraft (atleast conventional designs) don't fly faster than M=0.3 so right away density can be assumed to be constant. So can temperature and viscosity, and thermal conductivity is just zero. From the continuity and the momentumt conservation equations, the problem then boils down to solving for the three velocity components and the pressure distribution. More on that later.  "
