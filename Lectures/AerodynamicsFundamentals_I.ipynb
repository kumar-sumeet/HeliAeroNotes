    "This chapter is a whirlwind tour of some of the basics of airfoil aerodynamics that is relevant for this course. Since airfoils can be imagined as the basic building blocks that make up the rotor, the fundamental understanding of airfoil aerodynamics laid down here would help develop a more intuitive understanding of rotor aerodynamics. As some of the quotes above imply, the mathematical theory of fluid behavior, and by extension the mathematiacl theory of flight, are well established. However, given the complex equations involved a straightforward cause and effect relation is difficult to establish and hence a simple intuitive explanation for something even as common and fundamental as the process of lift generation on an airfoil is still missing. Nevertheless, below we try to make as much progress as possible in the improving/refreshing the understanding of the fundamental fluid dynamics concepts involved.\n",

    "Understanding the nature of forces acting on bodies of arbitrary shape is in our interest if the objective is to minimise the amount of work done in order to overcome the resistive forces due to friction caused due to relative motion between the body and the surrounding fluid. Optimum hull design of a cruise ship, minimum drag profile of a competitive road cyclist+cycle etc are a few examples where an understanding of fluid behavior would help achieve the objectives. Of course, we need not look too far for examples because a helicopter has various entities that might benefit from design based on a sound knowhow in fluid dynamics. A streamlined fuselage design such that drag (rotorcraft fuselage drag is referred to as parasite drag) is minimised would go a long way in reducing operating costs.  "

    "Fluid cannot penetrate the surface of the body in consideration. This seems like a trivial concept to state explicitly but remember that when a problem involving fluids is mathematically stated, the condition at the boundaries of the fluid need to be clearly defined. In the case of an airfoil moving about in *infinite* fluid, the surface of the airfoil forms one of the boundaries (the other boundary is at infinite distance away and not a source of any disturbance). What happens to the fluid at this boundary, i.e. the surface of the airfoil, dictates what happens in the rest of the fluid. This behavior of the fluid, specifically the velocity in the case of an incompressible flow, is the quantity of interest because this would then eventually lead to the amount of lift generated from the subsequent behavior of the fluid due to the airfoil motion. Since we know from physical observations that fluid parcels do not permeate through object surfaces, the motion of the fluid at this boundary is exactly matched with the motion of the airfoil surface. This is refered to as the no penetration boundary condition."

Even today, the fact that these equations are challenging to solve is what keeps many aerospace and mechanical engineers employed. Which is why in the early days of the invention of the airplane, and essentially the beginning of the field of aerodynamics, the exact mathematical theory to analyse the flow already existed (NSE had already been around for atleast half a century by the time of the first Wright brothers' flight) but was of little help since the equations couldn't be solved for the body of interest - a wing! Clever simplifications had to be devised based on meticulous experimental observations and astute engineering judgement so that the mathematical problem of lift generation could be posed in a way that it was atleast solvable, while of course simultaneously leading to results of acceptable accuracy. The schematic below shows the simplifications that are often adopted in fluid analyses based on the problem at hand.\n"

    "Irrotationality is a property of the flow (and not the fluid itself). The influence of this assumption is mathematically very apparent in that it leads to the fluid flow behavior to be represented using the Laplace's equation. Which is an incredible simplification because of the properties that the function $\\phi$, that statisfies the Laplace equation, is bound to exhibit. This is a linear equation which means it is amenable to superposition - i.e. flowfield around two bodies placed close to each other is the sum of the flow fields of the two bodies in isolation. The function $\\phi$ is continuous and differentiable (referred to as holomorphic in mathematical parlance) which means **any differentiable function represents the flow over some body!** We just need to identify the function that represents the flowfield over the body of interest to us - an airfoil or a flat plate (airfoil with zero thickness). Lastly, and from the point of view of early practioners in the field of aerodynamics, the ubiquity with which this function appears in different areas of physics - electrostatics, gravitation etc. - means that aerodynamiscists would not be alone in their struggle to identify solution strategies for the Laplace's equation."

    "The NSE are generally all that an aerospace engineer needs for all their aerodynamics analyses needs - five field partial differential equations and three constitutive relations to solve for three space coordinates (Lagrangian)/velocity components (Eulerian), pressure, density, temperature, viscosity and thermal conductivity. fuselage [^RotorWake] Being field equations, the NSE can be solved if the boundary conditions of the domain of investigation are known. In case of boundaries that form the interface with another material - for e.g. the surface of a wing - additional conditions need to be imposed since NSE do not cover the physics at such interfaces. Examples include \"no slip\" boundary condition typically employed for flow over solid boundaries and \"no temperature jump\" in case of a temperature differential.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Since the momentum conservation equations are part of the NSE, Newton's 2nd is definitely involved when describing flow behavior. However, simply attributing lift generated by an airfoil, for e.g., to just Newton's 2nd law is not entirely accurate. There is an obvious cause and effect relation when one talks about Newton's 2nd law. Within a fluid, however, the motion of continuum parcels is influenced by the forces exerted and the forces exerted are in turn influenced by the motion of these parcels. For e.g., the momentum equation above can be viewed as a form of Newton's second law of motion F=mass x acceleration, except that the forcing terms on the RHS of the equation - the pressure gradient and the shear stresses - are themselves a function of the fluid velocity. The complex interaction between the three sets of forces - inertial, pressure and shear - is what gives fluid dynamics its richness.\n",
    "\n",

    "[^RotorWake]: When modelling rotor wake there is not much to be gained from solving the most complex form of the problem. For e.g., most rotorcraft (atleast conventional designs) don't fly faster than M=0.3 so right away density can be assumed to be constant without incurring much error. So can temperature and viscosity, and thermal conductivity is just zero. From the continuity and the momentum conservation equations, the problem then boils down to solving for the three velocity components and the pressure distribution. More on that later.  "

    "Fluid dynamics, as it concerns aerospace engineering, is largely about keeping track of vorticity generation and vorticity transport. It is introduced into the flow due to no-slip condition at the airfoil surface (or the surface of any body for that matter). This vorticity doesn‘t just immediately dissipate/dissapear and keeping track of it is imperative to get overall aerodynamics right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the velocity profile within the boundary layer on the upper surface looks like that shown in figure (c) above, where the lower fluid layers always have a lower velocity than the ones above them leading to a shearing effect and consequently generate vorticity in the fluid. The figure below shows varying degrees of modelling fidelity where the vorticity distributed within the fluid volume in the boundary layer is approximated as lumped as a sheet over the surface of the airfoil itself or lumped over a line (usually the camber line of the airfoil). Alternately, the entire distributed circulatory effect of the airfoil can also be lumped at just one point on the airfoil (usually the quarter-chord). With each simplification the accuracy of the velocity field prediction is affected, especially close (within a few chord lengths) to the airfoil. However, for most applications (including rotary-wing analysis) representing the circulation around the airfoil as lumped at the quarter chord location suffices and modelling the wake of the blade (finite-wing) using Prandtl's lifting-line theory becomes more relevant for accurate analysis.\n"

Of course all of this is contingent on the continuity equation, which is a fundamental law of nature, and the irrotationality assumption. Its the latter condition that one needs to be mindfull of, since not all fluid flows satisfy that condition and potential flow theory based solutions would not be accurate in such scenarios.

    "Addition of a line vortex doesn't disturb the cylindrical geometry established by the doublet+uniform flow combination. However, the flow around the cylinder is changed dramatically so much so that now when the integrated effect of the pressure distribution is evaluated a non-zero lift exists. The drag force is still zero. Intuitively this makes sense because the flow is no longer has a top-down symmetry. Instead, a clockwise circulation leads to higher flow velocity at the upper surface of the cylinder and flow slows down at the lower surface. We know from the Bernoulli's relation that this should lead to lower pressure at the top and higher pressure at the bottom. "

    "This relation tells us the simple fact that lift is related to the circulation around the body in question. So if the circulation were zero, there would be no lift generated. On the other hand, if you knew precisely the circulation around the cross-section of cylinder, or more practical entities of interest such as a wing or a blade, you could get the lift per unit span and the total lift would simply be an integral over all such sections over its span. Precise experiments carried out in the wind tunnel by Bryant and Williams {cite}`Add54` with wing sections, where the flow velocities around these section have been measured, show that indeed the effect of an airfoil is to introduce a circulation around itself and that circulation everywhere else in the fluid domain is zero, or rather close to zero, such that the potential flow theory assumption of irrotational flow is not misplaced.

    "Based on the potential flow theory, lift generation can be predicted using a simple relation given by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. This raises the natural question, how does one obtain $\\Gamma$!? Potential flow theory, on its own cannot uniquely predict the amount of lift an airfoil is capable of generating. Since the amount of circulation in the flow is undecided, some more physics needs to be modelled in order to account for this. We could either go to the origins of the potential flow theory and see if some of the assumptions made can be relaxed to include more physics for this purpose. This is bound to make the equations more involved that the Laplace equation. Alternately, this is done using the Kutta condition. To illustrate the situation schematically, consider the two flow representations shown below for the same $\\alpha$ and $V_{\\infty}$ but different circulations around the airfoils. Both are valid/possible within the framework of potential flow theory, which one is correct?"

This is a consequence of the viscosity of fluids in nature and the fact that they cannot turn around sharp corners (airfoil trailing edges are sharp enough). Since potential flow theory doesn't model viscosity, a condition needs to be mathematically enforced so that the resulting flow field obtained is physically correct and unique[^uniqueness].

    "Potential flow theory alone cannot determine the amount of circulation around a body. This is true in the case of steady as well as unsteady aerodynamics. Even the widely used thin airfoil theory results of the lift curve slope=$2\\pi$, $C_{m_{c/4}}=0$ etc. are obtained after imposing an additional condition based on the flow physics. Purely following the mathematical construct of potential flow theory would not give us a unique solution (and hence *no* solution). The amount of circulation decides where the stagnation points would be. The Kutta condition tells us where the stagnation points ought to be in the case of flow around an airfoil. Therefore, by extension it helps identify a unique circulation that exists around an airfoil at a given angle of attack."

    "The Kutta condition is an engineering approximation that is based on experimental observations rather than mathematically derived from first principles. Images of flow field development taken at the instant flow is started around an airfoil suggest that there some flow turning occurs at the airfoil trailing edge but large shear forces encountered quickly make the flow pass smoothly at the trailing edge rather than turn around it. The Kutta condition is an indispensable part of introductory aerodynamics textbooks owing to the success of potential flow theory together with this empirically observed assumption."

    "For an inviscid, incompressible fluid of constant density, the circulation around any closed loop within the fluid remains time-invariant. For an airfoil initially at rest within a fluid, the circulation around any contour within the fluid is going to be zero. When the fluid is set in motion there is vorticity due to the uniform fluid velocity, yet we now know (from the discussion aboce) that there would be a circulation set around the airfoil. The Kelvin's circulation theorem implies that a vorticity of opposite sign must be getting introduced in the fluid so that the net circulation around any closed contour, that includes the airfoil in it, must be zero. The video below demonstrates this perfectly. A series of stillshots from the video above are also available in {cite}`BA14`."

    "The above, seemingly dissociated, set of concepts are nothing new and have been covered at length in fundamental fluid dynamics courses. These would all be used in order to build the framework for unsteady aerodynamics analyses. \n",

    "One thing worth emphasising again before moving on is that the Kutta condition is an engineering condition that is imposed on the flow in order to obtain deterministic properties of lift and moment around an airfoil. It is not derived mathematically from first principles. While it has successfully been used for steady airfoil analysis, unsteady airfoil analysis presents a challenge because experimental observations suggest that indeed the flow can briefly turn around the airfoil trailing-edge when rapid motion is involved. So the Kutta condition isn't strictly applicable for unsteady flows {cite}'A29_R51'. Neither is it helpful for cases when a sharp edge doesn't exist, for e.g. the airship-like body from the tests of Fuhrmann and Prandtl above, or when more than one sharp edges exist for some random profile (i.e. not necessarily an airfoil-like profile). However, early unsteady airfoil theory was developed accepting the validity of the Kutta condition even for unsteady airfoil motion and has been shown to provide acceptable prediction of unsteady airfoil lift and moments.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Potential flow theory-based results remain meaningful only in when the flow remains attached to the airfoil. In flow conditions where there is large scale separation, the linearity imposed on the solutions by the potential flow theory introduces inaccuracies. If you are still wondering, how on Earth does a flow model based on zero viscosity give results that are representative of viscous real-world flows well you are not alone since some of the brightest minds of the 20th century struggled with the same ideas. This struggle is chronicled in {cite}`BA13` as a clash between the British and the German school of aerodynamicists. The theories proposed by the latter school were eventually universally accepted once supporting experimental evidence was obtained and the entire saga has been artfully concluded in the final passages of {cite}`BA13`."

    "```{admonition} David Bloor in 'Enigma of the Aerofoil'\n",
    "The German advances in the understanding of lift and the properties of wings depended on the use of abstract and unreal concepts that were sometimes employed with questionable logic. Progress in aerodynamics thus depended on the triumph of falsity over truth. Everyone knows that false premises can sometimes lead to true conclusions and that evidence can sometimes support false theories, but the story of the aerofoil involved more than this. The successful strategy involved the deliberate use of known falsehoods poised in artful balance with accepted truths. The supporters of the theory of circulation showed how simple falsehoods could yield dependable conclusions when dealing with a complex and otherwise intractable reality. This is the real enigma of the aerofoil... The enigma of the aerofoil is the enigma of all knowledge.\n",
