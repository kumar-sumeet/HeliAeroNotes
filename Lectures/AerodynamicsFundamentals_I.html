Since airfoils can be imagined as the basic building blocks that make up the rotor, the fundamental understanding of airfoil aerodynamics laid down here would help develop a more intuitive understanding of rotor aerodynamics. As some of the quotes above imply, the mathematical theory of fluid behavior, and by extension the mathematiacl theory of flight, are well established. However, given the complex equations involved a straightforward cause and effect relation is difficult to establish and hence a simple intuitive explanation for something even as common and fundamental as the process of lift generation on an airfoil is still missing.

<p>Understanding the nature of forces acting on bodies of arbitrary shape is in our interest if the objective is to minimise the amount of work done in order to overcome the resistive forces due to friction caused due to relative motion between the body and the surrounding fluid. Optimum hull design of a cruise ship, minimum drag profile of a competitive road cyclist+cycle etc are a few examples where an understanding of fluid behavior would help achieve the objectives. Of course, we need not look too far for examples because a helicopter has various entities that might benefit from design based on a sound knowhow in fluid dynamics. A streamlined fuselage design such that drag (rotorcraft fuselage drag is referred to as parasite drag) is minimised would go a long way in reducing operating costs.</p>

<h2>Navier-Stokes equations (NSE)<a class="headerlink" href="#navier-stokes-equations-nse" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The NSE are essential to so many analyses you encounter involving fluid flows yet they can be solved without the use of a computer for only a handful of idealised scenarios. Even today, the fact that these equations are challenging to solve is what keeps many aerospace and mechanical engineers employed. Which is why in the early days of the invention of the airplane, and essentially the beginning of the field of aerodynamics, the exact mathematical theory to analyse the flow already existed (NSE had already been around for atleast half a century by the time of the first Wright brothersâ flight) but was of little help since the equations couldnât be solved for the body of interest - a wing! Clever simplifications had to be devised based on meticulous experimental observations and astute engineering judgement so that the mathematical problem of lift generation could be posed in a way that it was atleast solvable, while of course simultaneously leading to results of acceptable accuracy. The schematic below shows the simplifications that are often adopted in fluid analyses based on the problem at hand.</p>

    <p  style="font-size:16px; color:gray; text-align:center;"> Fluid models and equations with different approximations  </p>
</center><p>The assumptions that lead to simplifications are the following-</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>no viscosity</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Viscosity is a property of the fluid. Given the low kinematic viscosity of air, the viscous terms can be assumed to be much smaller than the other terms in certain scenarios leading to the Euler equation. However, even the Euler equation cannot be solved analytically.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>incompressibility</p></li>
</ul>
<p>assuming that the air in incompressible registers an error in the density of only about 3% for flow velocity upto Mach number 0.3. Clearly, for low speed applications this assumption is a reasonable one.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>irrotationality</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Irrotationality is a property of the flow (and not the fluid itself). The influence of this assumption is mathematically very apparent in that it leads to the fluid flow behavior to be represented using the Laplaceâs equation. Which is an incredible simplification because of the properties that the function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span>, that statisfies the Laplace equation, is bound to exhibit. This is a linear equation which means it is amenable to superposition - i.e. flowfield around two bodies placed close to each other is the sum of the flow fields of the two bodies in isolation. The function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> is continuous and differentiable (referred to as holomorphic in mathematical parlance) which means <strong>any differentiable function represents the flow over some body!</strong> We just need to identify the function that represents the flowfield over the body of interest to us - an airfoil or a flat plate (airfoil with zero thickness). Lastly, and from the point of view of early practioners in the field of aerodynamics, the ubiquity with which this function appears in different areas of physics - electrostatics, gravitation etc. - means that aerodynamiscists would not be alone in their struggle to identify solution strategies for the Laplaceâs equation.</p>

<h2>Simple governing laws, complex results<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-governing-laws-complex-results" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The NSE are generally all that an aerospace engineer needs for all their aerodynamics analyses needs - five field partial differential equations and three constitutive relations to solve for three space coordinates (Lagrangian)/velocity components (Eulerian), pressure, density, temperature, viscosity and thermal conductivity. fuselage <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#rotorwake" id="id4">1</a> Being field equations, the NSE can be solved if the boundary conditions of the domain of investigation are known. In case of boundaries that form the interface with another material - for e.g. the surface of a wing - additional conditions need to be imposed since NSE do not cover the physics at such interfaces. Examples include âno slipâ boundary condition typically employed for flow over solid boundaries and âno temperature jumpâ in case of a temperature differential.</p>
<p>Since the momentum conservation equations are part of the NSE, Newtonâs 2nd is definitely involved when describing flow behavior. However, simply attributing lift generated by an airfoil, for e.g., to just Newtonâs 2nd law is not entirely accurate. There is an obvious cause and effect relation when one talks about Newtonâs 2nd law. Within a fluid, however, the motion of continuum parcels is influenced by the forces exerted and the forces exerted are in turn influenced by the motion of these parcels. For e.g., the momentum equation above can be viewed as a form of Newtonâs second law of motion F=mass x acceleration, except that the forcing terms on the RHS of the equation - the pressure gradient and the shear stresses - are themselves a function of the fluid velocity. The complex interaction between the three sets of forces - inertial, pressure and shear - is what gives fluid dynamics its richness.</p>
<p>Such implicit relations of relatively simple local physics (conservation laws) buried within the NSE make an intuitive foresight of what would happen in the global flowfield difficult. Below is an informal discussion of the mechanism by which airfoils generate lift to exemplify this.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Aside</p>
<p>If the picture on the left above is assumed to be the <em>true</em> fluid model, then it is easy to see that the lift generated would be proportional to square of the angle of attack. However, we now know that airfoil lift is proportional to angle of attack (at least when the flow is not significantly separated). This is also evident from the pressure contours around an airfoil shown below - doubling the anlge of attack doubles the pressure difference, the amount of fluid influenced stays the same.</p>

<p>Notice that viscosity did not come up in explanation above. Viscosity plays a key role in the ability of airfoil sections to produce lift in that it ensures that the fluid doesnât turn around the trailing edge. However, it is not necessary in order to quantify the amount of lift which is why simple potential flow theory models, such as thin airfoil theory, are capable to predicting airfoil lift to a good degree of accuracy. Even when the flow conditions are unsteady, potential flow theory-based unsteady models are just as capable in predicting the unsteady lift and moment variation.</p>

</center><p>Fluid dynamics, as it concerns aerospace engineering, is largely about keeping track of vorticity generation and vorticity transport. It is introduced into the flow due to no-slip condition at the airfoil surface (or the surface of any body for that matter). This vorticity doesnât just immediately dissipate/dissapear and keeping track of it is imperative to get overall aerodynamics right.</p>
<p>Recall that the velocity profile within the boundary layer on the upper surface looks like that shown in figure (c) above, where the lower fluid layers always have a lower velocity than the ones above them leading to a shearing effect and consequently generate vorticity in the fluid. The figure below shows varying degrees of modelling fidelity where the vorticity distributed within the fluid volume in the boundary layer is approximated as lumped as a sheet over the surface of the airfoil itself or lumped over a line (usually the camber line of the airfoil). Alternately, the entire distributed circulatory effect of the airfoil can also be lumped at just one point on the airfoil (usually the quarter-chord). With each simplification the accuracy of the velocity field prediction is affected, especially close (within a few chord lengths) to the airfoil. However, for most applications (including rotary-wing analysis) representing the circulation around the airfoil as lumped at the quarter chord location suffices and modelling the wake of the blade (finite-wing) using Prandtlâs lifting-line theory becomes more relevant for accurate analysis.</p>

<p>We are fixated quite a bit on the rotationality of the flow <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nabla \times \mathbf{V}\)</span>, or its lack thereof. This is for a good reason, the irrotationality condition <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nabla \times \mathbf{V} = 0\)</span> guarantees the existence of a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> such that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{V} = \nabla \phi\)</span>. This, together with the continuity equation for an incompressible flow gives the Laplaceâs equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \nabla^2 \phi = 0\)</span>. This is valid irrespective of whether the flow is unsteady and is true for both 2D and 3D representations. Alternately, if we begin with the incompressibility assumption <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nabla.\mathbf{V} = 0\)</span>, then for the special case of 2D flow scenarios the irrotationality assumption allows the possibility of some function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\psi\)</span> such that -</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mathbf{V} = u\hat{i} + v\hat{j}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[u = \frac{\partial \psi }{\partial y }, v = -\frac{\partial \psi }{\partial x } \]</div>
<p>The above formulation was based on the validity of the continuity equation but it automatically satisfies the irrotationality condition -</p>

Of course all of this is contingent on the continuity equation, which is a fundamental law of nature, and the irrotationality assumption.

Additionally, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F(z)\)</span> also follows the Laplaceâs equation-</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\nabla^2 F(z) = 0\]</div>
<p>This is a useful because the Laplaceâs equation is linear. If the function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F(z)\)</span> can simply be evaluated for simple elementary flows and these elementary flows can be used to create the flow field around any complicated geometry then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F(z)\)</span> can be obtained essentially for any complicated geometry. Knowing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F(z)\)</span>, the flow velocity around any geometry can be evaluated and thereafter using the Bernoulliâs equation to get the pressure distribution is a straightforward excercise. The question arises, what are these elementary flows?</p>

</center><p>Due to the low magnitude of kinematic viscosity (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu/\rho\)</span>) of air, most flows of interest to an aerospace engineer occur at high Reynolds numbers (&gt;<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^6\)</span>) and low angles of attack <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>. In such conditions the flow can be modelled reasonably well by dropping the viscous terms (i.e. assuming <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu=0\)</span>, limiting case of a viscous fluid).  Of course, one runs the risk of not being able to model effects of flow separation (which are viscous in nature), viscous drag etc. But the speed and ease of solving the fluid flow equations assuming <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu=0\)</span> as well as the physicality of the results has led to the popularity of the potential flow theory. Even extensions to this theory have been proposed that account for the viscous effects in some adhoc way but without having to solve the full NSE equations. In fact for low Mach number flows, the fluid equations can be further simplified and yet be physically representative of the real flow field.</p>
<p>When the irrotationality and the incompressibilty assumptions are made along with zero viscosity, the NSE reduce to two eqs - the Laplacian and the Bernoulliâs eq.</p>

<h2>Kutta-Joukowski theorem<a class="headerlink" href="#kutta-joukowski-theorem" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Addition of a line vortex doesnât disturb the cylindrical geometry established by the doublet+uniform flow combination. However, the flow around the cylinder is changed dramatically so much so that now when the integrated effect of the pressure distribution is evaluated a non-zero lift exists. The drag force is still zero. Intuitively this makes sense because the flow is no longer has a top-down symmetry. Instead, a clockwise circulation leads to higher flow velocity at the upper surface of the cylinder and flow slows down at the lower surface. We know from the Bernoulliâs relation that this should lead to lower pressure at the top and higher pressure at the bottom.</p>

<h2>Kelvinâs circulation theorem<a class="headerlink" href="#kelvin-s-circulation-theorem" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>For an inviscid, incompressible fluid of constant density, the circulation around any closed loop within the fluid remains time-invariant. For an airfoil initially at rest within a fluid, the circulation around any contour within the fluid is going to be zero. When the fluid is set in motion there is vorticity due to the uniform fluid velocity, yet we now know (from the discussion aboce) that there would be a circulation set around the airfoil. The Kelvinâs circulation theorem implies that a vorticity of opposite sign must be getting introduced in the fluid so that the net circulation around any closed contour, that includes the airfoil in it, must be zero.</p>

<h2>Final Comments<a class="headerlink" href="#final-comments" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The above, seemingly dissociated, set of concepts are nothing new and have been covered at length in fundamental fluid dynamics courses. These would all be used in order to build the framework for unsteady aerodynamics analyses.</p>
<p>One thing worth emphasising again before moving on is that the Kutta condition is an engineering condition that is imposed on the flow in order to obtain deterministic properties of lift and moment around an airfoil. It is not derived mathematically from first principles. While it has successfully been used for steady airfoil analysis, unsteady airfoil analysis presents a challenge because experimental observations suggest that indeed the flow can briefly turn around the airfoil trailing-edge when rapid motion is involved. So the Kutta condition isnât strictly applicable for unsteady flows {cite}âA29_R51â. Neither is it helpful for cases when a sharp edge doesnât exist, for e.g. the airship-like body from the tests of Fuhrmann and Prandtl above, or when more than one sharp edges exist for some random profile (i.e. not necessarily an airfoil-like profile). However, early unsteady airfoil theory was developed accepting the validity of the Kutta condition even for unsteady airfoil motion and has been shown to provide acceptable prediction of unsteady airfoil lift and moments.</p>
<p>Potential flow theory-based results remain meaningful only in when the flow remains attached to the airfoil. In flow conditions where there is large scale separation, the linearity imposed on the solutions by the potential flow theory introduces inaccuracies. If you are still wondering, how on Earth does a flow model based on zero viscosity give results that are representative of viscous real-world flows well you are not alone since some of the brightest minds of the 20th century struggled with the same ideas. This struggle is chronicled in <span id="id18">[<a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id37">Blo19</a>]</span> as a clash between the British and the German school of aerodynamicists. The theories proposed by the latter school were eventually universally accepted once supporting experimental evidence was obtained and the entire saga has been artfully concluded in the final passages of <span id="id19">[<a class="reference internal" href="References.html#id37">Blo19</a>]</span>.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">David Bloor in âEnigma of the Aerofoilâ</p>
<p>The German advances in the understanding of lift and the properties of wings depended on the use of abstract and unreal concepts that were sometimes employed with questionable logic. Progress in aerodynamics thus depended on the triumph of falsity over truth. Everyone knows that false premises can sometimes lead to true conclusions and that evidence can sometimes support false theories, but the story of the aerofoil involved more than this. The successful strategy involved the deliberate use of known falsehoods poised in artful balance with accepted truths. The supporters of the theory of circulation showed how simple falsehoods could yield dependable conclusions when dealing with a complex and otherwise intractable reality. This is the real enigma of the aerofoilâ¦ The enigma of the aerofoil is the enigma of all knowledge.</p>

<dd><p>When modelling rotor wake there is not much to be gained from solving the most complex form of the problem. For e.g., most rotorcraft (atleast conventional designs) donât fly faster than M=0.3 so right away density can be assumed to be constant without incurring much error. So can temperature and viscosity, and thermal conductivity is just zero. From the continuity and the momentum conservation equations, the problem then boils down to solving for the three velocity components and the pressure distribution. More on that later.</p>

<dd><p>For most applications the gradient of the potential function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> is evaluated in the cartesian coordinates. However, finite-state inflow models exist (also called dynamic inflow models) where the induced flow of a rotor is evaluated using a potential flow theory-based solution of the rotor. Here, the Laplacian is solved in ellipsoidal coordinates because the problem is amenable to an analytical solution in such a system. One of the most common such inflow model used extensively in real-time rotor simulations is the Peter-He inflow model.</p>
