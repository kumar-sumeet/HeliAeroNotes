    "The objective of this course is to introduce physical concepts that are relevant for understanding and analysis of rotary-wings (as helicopter rotors are also referred to) in hover, axial and edgewise flight. The course would focus predominantly on aerodynamic aspects of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) flight. Knowledge of aerodynamics of fixed-wing aircraft doesn't directly apply when studying *rotating* wings (hence the name *rotary-wing*). Of course, fundamental fluid dynamics concepts that govern the aerodynamics of fixed-wings also govern the aerodynamics of rotary-winged aircraft. However, as you would learn in the course, the manner in which the flow field evolves and the consitutuent flow structures are very different for the two classes of flying vehicles. Additionally, airfoil stall and unsteady aerodynamics theories are usually discussed in the context of fixed-wing aircraft but are fundamental to accurately predict rotorcraft performance and will be introduced in this course. A lot of jargon, specific to rotorcraft, will be introduced as well. The structural dynamics is very different too but that's for another course.   "

    "Many pecularities associated with helicopters can be inferred from the required power breakdown over the operational regime. The decrease in the total power that follows immediately after the helicopter transitions from hover to forwards flight is striking. It is apparent that the highest power is consumed by a helicopter in hover and in high fast forward flight states. Of course, why that is exactly the case would be covered in detail in the following lectures. This unintuitive behavior of the power consumption by a helicopter (after all, why should a helicopter that is still with respect to the ground consume more energy per unit time that one that is moving forward and therefore has associated drag that needs to be overcome?!) leads to interesting performance characteristics. This also has critical design consequences - 'hot and high' hover requirements might end up deciding the size of the engine installed because of high power requirement."
