    "The method of singularities presents an alternate technique of obtaining the flow field around an airfoil. Here, the flow field is obtained by directly placing singularities on the airfoil surface and satisfying the no penetration boundary condition on the surface of the airfoil itself. Afterall, this is the bare minimum physical law that the fluid flowing around the airfoil has to satisfy - it cannot flow through the surface of the airfoil. \n",

    "However, unlike the conformal mapping technique above where $\\Gamma$ is the total circulation due to distributed vorticity over the airfoil, the strength of $\\Gamma$ here is obtained by satifying the no penetration condition only at a single point on the airfoil called the collocation point. In this case, the collocation point is chosen to be the $3c/4$ location to be resultant $\\Gamma$ to be consistent with the result obtained from conformal mapping technique.\n",
