The fact that these equations are challenging to solve is what keeps many aerospace and mechanical engineers employed."

However, simply attributing lift generated by an airfoil, for e.g., to just Newton's 2nd law is not entirely accurate. There is an obvious cause and effect relation when one talks about Newton's 2nd law. Within a fluid, however, the motion of continuum parcels is influenced by the forces exerted and the forces exerted are in turn influenced by the motion of these parcels.\n",
