    "Theodore Theodorsen was first to publish a complete and detailed solution to the problem of aerodynamic loads on an oscillating lifting surface. Chapter 5 in {cite}`BAE0` is a great resource for understanding the theoretical foundations of the Theodorsen model (even *better* than the original paper by Dr Theodorsen that describes the model {cite}`A21`). That said, the complete derivation is mathematically involved and requires meticulously solving a lot of complex-valued integrals. Here we will start with the final results proposed by Theodorsen and work our way to backwards with the motivation to understand the expressions involved intuitively and take assummptions involved at face value.\n",

    "In the analysis of dynamical systems there has been sufficient progress so much so that there are multiple domains of modelling strategies that are available for one to chose from - frequency response, state-space, time-domain and impulse response. All these strategies apply to linear systems only and are equivalent in that any one form can bbe obtained from any one of the other forms. Dynamical systems are often studied in the frequency domain because the linearity assumption means that solving for the system response becomes especially straightforward once the trasfer function $G(s)$ of the system is known. $G(s)$ relates the input forcing of the system at a given frequency to the output response of the system at the same frequency but now at a different amplitude as well as a phase shift.\n",

    "Potential flow theory is based on the inviscid assumption so clearly the predicted drag force (i.e. force along the direction of flow) is zero leading to the d'Alembert's paradox. Of course this is not much of a paradox now given we modelled the fluid as an ideal fluid is some sense by ignoring viscosity altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, *unsteadiness* comes from accounting for the vorticity in the wake and when wake vorticity (as in the case of the starting vortex) is not acocunted for the flow is considered to be steady. In addition, a steady airfoil generates lift which is purely due to the circulation of the flow but an airfoil undergoing unsteady motion will generate an added lift that is due to the displacement of the surrounding fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the discussion till now, it is clear that there is a significant difference between the wake of an airfoil when it maintains a constant angle of attck versus when the airfoil is pitching. The difference arises due to the shed vorticity in the airfoil wake. In case of steady airfoil, the starting vortex convects far away but in case of the pitching airfoil vorticity is constantly being shed due to the changing bound circulation around the airfoil. These shed vortices in the vicinity of the airfoil have the potential to influence the aerodynamics of the airfoil and need to be accounted for. The criterion used to decide the threshold when unsteady aerodynamic effects might be significant enough, that they cannot be ignored, is called reduced frequency. "
