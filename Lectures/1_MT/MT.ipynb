    "An aerodynamicist in the early 20th century is very much familiar with the fundamental conservation laws governing fluid dynamics - the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), a set of nonlinear partial differential field equations in space and time that should, in principle, give you the flow behavior for rotors (in hover, or forward flight state) much as they would for wings in forward flight. However, analytical solutions to the NSE are available only for a handful of very simple flows (or rather simple boundary conditions). Instead of waiting around for a powerful enough computational device to be invented to solve the most complicated form of the problem, aerodynamicists at the time solved the problem by introducing assumptions/idealisations to the rotor flow problem. The result is the momentum theory whose equations are much easier to solve. Turns out the dominant flow characterisitcs of a rotor are indeed dictated by these simpler equations. If one is seeking the relationship between T and P for a rotor of given R, momentum theory is a very simple alternative.  "

    "The details of momentum theory are discussed here as they apply in the context of a helicopter rotor. In hover, the rotor generates thrust by propelling the surrounding fluid in the opposite direction. This requires energy, since the kinetic energy imparted to the surrounding fluid has to come from somewhere, and chemical energy of the fuel burnt onboard the helicopter provides this. In addition to the energy needed to 'push' the air (to hover), energy gets expended separately to overcome friction encountered by the rotor blades as well as imparting swirl to the flow. The latter is just a by-product of the rotational motion of the helicopter rotor. There are different variations to momentum theory, we'll just be concerned with the simplest version. So, we ignore the viscous and swirl losses and consider the rotor operates by just pushing the air down."

    "The induced velocity $v$ is flow velocity at the rotor disk itself. Flow velocity impinging on the fuselage is not going to be very different from this value. If a lift-augmented design of the Mi-6 is considered, knowledge of $v$ would directly give us a quantitative understanding of the *download* on the wing. Similarly, the download force experienced by the helicopter because of fuselage can be roughly ascertained.  "

    "The fact that the rotor is not an actuator disk but rather a geomteric entity with finite number of lifting surfaces (blades) leads to physical phenomena that have not been mentioned in the above discussion or the derivation of the results. Consequently, the derived momentum theory results do not include their effects. Turns out these effects are non-negligible and can result in an error of atleast 10-15% in the power calculation of most rotors if not accounted for. So, the way they are accounted for is using an empirical (i.e. based on experimental results) parameter called induced power factor $\\kappa$.

    "While $\\kappa$ helps improve the power prediction using momentum theory, all the shortcomings of momentum theory discussed earlier still persist. For e.g. nothing in the equation above tells us whether a rotor designed for (say) a 5-ton helicopter would also be able to generate 100-tons of thrust! Obviously, the answer is no. The fact that airfoil blades would stall after a certain point and fail to generate any further lift is simply not included in any form within the assumptions or the derivation (go ahead, scroll up and convince yourself that that is the case!)\n",
    "There are no free lunches. Since the momentum theory is based on approximations introduced to the NSE, we cannot obtain all information about the rotor operation or as quantitatively accurate results as can potentially be obtained using NSE. In other words the momentum theory approximations are appropriate in certain scenarios and as a consequence the theory will lead to pretty reliable results. In a lot of other scenarios where the approximations don't apply or are violated, the results will be *bad*. "
