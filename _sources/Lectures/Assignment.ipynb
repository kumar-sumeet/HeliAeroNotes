    "The Igor I. Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Competition was a $250k competition by the American Helicopter Society and sponsored by Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. The aim was to construct and fly a helicopter purely on human power. This was finally achieved by a team from the University of Toronto, with a team from the University of Maryland also accomplishing the goals of the competition (only later). The objective of this assignement is to read relevant literature about these designs and explain the most critical aspects, only from the rotor aerodynamics point of view, within 2000-2500 words. In case a graph or figure is required then that counts as 200 words. Accordingly, the exercise is not just about summarising the design decisions of the two teams but to explain them as best as possible within the framework of everything covered in this course. "
