    "BEMT is a pretty useful framework to see trends during initial conceptual design phase of a rotorcraft. This not only applies to large scale multi-ton rotorcraft but also to drones {cite}`Add43`. Folks in the rotorcraft research community continue to publish results obtained from BEMT-based analyses and tweak/improve it for their use case. Here are some of the relevant example publications - . These should convince you of the relevance of BEMT within the context of analysis of new rotor designs. Of course BEMT is not the complete story and, based on the assumptions that the theory is built on, there is room for better aerodynamic models that model more physics than the BEMT does. Such models do exist and are briefly discussed below in general terms.   "

    "Finally, the formulation we have gone through assumed azimuthal symmetry of induced inflow. This assumption is valide only for hover and axial flight but breaks down during edgewise rotor flight. However, BEMT has been extended to model rotor performance also in forward flight taking into account the variation of induced inflow both over the radial span of the blade as well as the azimuth location. Generally, these are termed as 'hybrid' BEMT and you can find them in literature using this term. "
