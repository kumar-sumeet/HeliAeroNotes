    "The rotor performance is an accumulated effect of the blade section (airfoil) aerodynamics over one rotor revolution. So the natural question arises, what kind of airfoil performance characteristics ($C_L$, $C_D$, $C_M$) are desirable for rotorcraft applications? The answer is not immediately obvious because, unlike their fixed-wing counterparts, helicopter blades experience varying oncoming flow velocities and different operating angles of attack over one revolution. Nevertheless, certain broad trends exist."

In addition, the unsteady aerodynamics behavior of the airfoil also becomes relevant (as would be discussed later). Understandably, the choice of airfoil section is much more complicated in comparison to a fixed-wing aircraft where the airfoil can simply be optimised for cruise speed. The oncoming flow velocity is then fixed and the angle of attack of the airfoil sections on an operational wing do not vary much. In contrast, at a given cruise speed the rotor blade section sees harmonically varying oncoming flow velocity while undergoing pitching and additional motion due to blade elastic deformation."
