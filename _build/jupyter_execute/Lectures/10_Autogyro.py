# Autogyros (or Gyrocopters) are a class of aircraft with a pusher prop and a rotor that is tilted backwards and rotate freely in the air. 
# Take-off only possible with some run-up
# Alternately, engine power diverted to the rotor temporarily to rotate it
# Rotate rotor with low pitch setting and then quickly raise

# So the rotor is unpowered and provides lift using autorotation
# Jumpy take-off exhibited by and Autogyro where the engine power is transmitted to the rotor via a clutch mechanism.
