The blade aerodynamics needs to be modelled separately but, as we shall see, the dynamic inflow models that'll be discussed put no restriction on the blade models used. The blade could be undergoing highly non-linear aerodynamics - for e.g. dynamic stall - and the blade model could be coupled with the dynamic inflow model and still be valid within the purview of dynamic inflow modelling."
