    "These precede the development of helicopters as we know it because replacing the wing with a freely spinning rotor, i.e. the rotor is not connected to the engine, is mechanically simpler than having a powered rotor with all the complicacies that arise from a controls point of view. Additionally, we now know that true VTOL capability places the demand for a lot of power on the aircraft powerplant.... "

    "The rotor, which is not attached to the aircraft engine, ends up doing the work of the fixed-wing. This is accomplished by inclining the rotor backwards (*positive* shaft tilt). The necessary thust to keep the aircraft aloft comes from the rotation of the rotor enabled by the air going through from below the rotor. The energy needed to keep the rotor spinning in this case is extracted from the kinetic energy of the air flowing through the rotor. The constant aircraft forward motion is enabled by the pusher propeller, without which the flow through the main rotor would stop and aircraft would start losing altitude and eventually settling perhaps in an autorotation state not unlike a conventional helicopter. \n",
