All these strategies apply to linear systems only and are equivalent in that any one form can bbe obtained from any one of the other forms. Dynamical systems are often studied in the frequency domain because the linearity assumption means that solving for the system response becomes especially straightforward once the trasfer function $G(s)$ of the system is known. $G(s)$ relates the input forcing of the system at a given frequency to the output response of the system at the same frequency but now at a different amplitude as well as a phase shift.\n",

In the case of an airfoil moving about it *infinite* fluid, the surface of the airfoil forms one of the boundaries (the other boundary is at infinite distance away and not a source of any discturbance). What happens to the fluid at this boundary, i.e. the surface of the airfoil, dictates what happens in the rest of the fluid. This behavior of the fluid, specifically the velocity in the case of an incompressible flow, is the quantity of interest because this would then eventually lead to the amount of lift generated from the subsequent behavior of the fluid due to the airfoil motion. Since we know from physical observations that fluid parcels do not permeate through object surfaces, the motion of the fluid at this boundary is exactly matched with the motion of the airfoil surface.
