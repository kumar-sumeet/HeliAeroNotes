# ## BEMT: ...
# 
# * BEMT provides the simplest strategy of separating out the solutions of the blades aerodynamics and effect of the wake
# * Higher-fidelity solution strategies employ same principle
# * Different rotor wake models as well as methods to solve for the blade aerodynamics exist
# * Solving for rotor aerodynamics
