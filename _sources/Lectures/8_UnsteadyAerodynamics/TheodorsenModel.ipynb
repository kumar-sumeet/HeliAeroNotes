    "Theodore Theodorsen was first to publish a complete and detailed solution to the problem of aerodynamic loads on an oscillating lifting surface. Chapter 5 in {cite}`BAE0` is a great resource for understanding the theoretical foundations of the Theodorsen model (even *better* than the original paper by Dr Theodorsen that describes the model {cite}`A21`). That said, the complete derivation is mathematically involved and requires meticulously solving a lot of complex-valued integrals. Here we will start with the final results proposed by Theodorsen and work our way to backwards with the motivation to understand the expressions involved intuitively and take assummptions involved at face value.\n",

    "In the analysis of dynamical systems there has been sufficient progress so much so that there are multiple domains of modelling strategies that are available for one to choose from - frequency response, state-space, time-domain and impulse response. All these strategies apply to linear systems only and are equivalent in that any one form can be obtained from any one of the other forms. Dynamical systems are often studied in the frequency domain because the linearity assumption means that solving for the system response becomes especially straightforward once the transfer function $G(s)$ of the system is known. $G(s)$ relates the input forcing of the system at a given frequency to the output response of the system at the same frequency but now at a different amplitude as well as a phase shift.\n",

Additionally, during forward flight motion there is a large time-varying component of the oncoming flow velocity too.

In fact as $t\\rightarrow \\infty$ so does $z\\rightarrow \\infty$, making the total lift generated by the airfoil reduce to the familiar Kutta-Joukowski expression.

    "In summary, *unsteadiness* comes from accounting for the vorticity in the wake and when wake vorticity (as in the case of the starting vortex) is not acocunted for the flow is considered to be steady. In addition, a steady airfoil generates lift which is purely due to the circulation of the flow but an airfoil undergoing unsteady motion will generate an added lift that is due to the displacement of the surrounding fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Theodorsen model is a solution of the unsteady potential flow so the problem of fluid flow represents a linear problem. Potential flow theory is based on the inviscid assumption so clearly the predicted drag force (i.e. force along the direction of flow) is zero leading to the d'Alembert's paradox. Of course this is not much of a paradox now given we modelled the fluid as an ideal fluid is some sense by ignoring viscosity altogether. Therefore, the Theodorsen model does not make any prediction about the nature of drag.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the discussion till now, it is clear that there is a significant difference between the wake of an airfoil when it maintains a constant angle of attack versus when the airfoil is pitching. The difference arises due to the shed vorticity in the airfoil wake. In case of steady airfoil, the starting vortex convects far away but in case of the pitching airfoil vorticity is constantly being shed due to the changing bound circulation around the airfoil. These shed vortices in the vicinity of the airfoil have the potential to influence the aerodynamics of the airfoil and need to be accounted for. The criterion used to decide the threshold when unsteady aerodynamic effects might be significant enough, that they cannot be ignored, is called reduced frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in general, in order to evaluate the aerodynamic load (steady or unsteady) acting on rotating wings, the set of non-linear PDE called NSE need to be solved. This can be a daunting excercise using CFD methods that is both computationally intensive, i.e. requiring significant computing infrastructure, as well as time consuming, i.e. it would be a few days before you would see the final result! The lifting line theory presents a great simplification in that what happens to the flow in the rotor wake can be modelled separate from the effect of flow on the blade itself. The effect of the rotor wake is modelled as an inflow that can be obtained via a hierarchy of inflow models of varying levels of fidelity but we discussed the simplest ones in this course - the momentum theory and the blade element momentum theory. The blade element momentum theory requires prior knowledge of the airfoil characterisicts (i.e. $C_l$, $C_d$ and $C_m$) but presents a vast improvement over the simple momentum theory in that the effect of using different airfoils making up the blade sections can be accounted for. These airfoil characteristics are based on steady state airfoil aerodynamics. This solution strategy has proven to provide acceptable results in hover and very low speed forward flight but not for high speed forward flight cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "When unsteady motion of the airfoil is involved, like in forward flight conditions, even an airfoil has a wake whose effect on the airfoil section itself needs to be accounted for in order to evaluate lift, drag and moment on the airfoil accurately. So if we consider the general case of a rotor where the blades are undergoing unsteady motion then one component of the rotor wake vorticity is due to the finiteness of the wings and a secondary component now exists due to the unsteady motion of the blade sections that make up the rotor. Instead of solving for the influence of this combined complex wake on the blade sections, i.e. evaluating the induced inflow, we use the same strategy as used in the case of steady rotor aerodynamics. We can do this be evaluating the effect of the unsteady airfoil wake on the airfoil loads, this is where the Theodorsen theory comes in handy when harmonic motion is involved. Once the effect of the airfoil wake has been accounted for, the effect of the rest of the wake (due to finite wing effects) can be treated using blade element momentum theory. This is the standard process used for modelling rotor aerodynamics using 'non-CFD' methods. There exist a number of unsteady airfoil aerodynamics analysis models (particularly in the field of helicopter aerodynamics) one can choose from - Peters model, indicial response methods, state-space modelling etc. - for quantifying the airfoil wake effects on blade section loads and once they are known the rotor inflow can be obtained using BEMT. Here too a number of models exist in addition to the annular momentum theory - for e.g. dynamic inflow, free-wake, lifting surface, vortex particles etc.- but, irrespective of the specific models used, the overarching strategy towards a quick solution follows the standard strategy convexed through this course.
