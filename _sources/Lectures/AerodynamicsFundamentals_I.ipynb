    "The NSE are essential to so many analyses you encounter involving fluid flows yet they can be solved without the use of a computer for only a handful of idealised scenarios. Even today, the fact that these equations are challenging to solve is what keeps many aerospace and mechanical engineers employed. Which is why in the early days of the invention of the airplane, and essentially the beginning of the field of aerodynamics, the exact mathematical theory to analyse the flow already existed (NSE had already been around for atleast half a century by the time of the first Wright brothers' flight) but was of little help since the equations couldn't be solved! Clever simplifications had to be devised based on meticulous experimental observations and astute engineering judgement so that the mathematical problem of lift generation could be posed in a way that it was atleast solvable, while of course simultaneously leading to results of acceptable accuracy. The schematic below shows the simplifications that are often adopted in fluid analyses based on the problem at hand.\n"

    "the influence of this assumption is mathematically very apparent in that it leads to the fluid flow behavior to be represented using the Laplace's equation. Which is an incredible simplification because of the properties that the function $\\phi$, that statisfies the Laplace equation, is bound to exhibit. This is a linear equation which means it is amenable to superposition - i.e. flowfield around two bodies placed close to each other is the sum of the flow fields of the two bodies separately. The function $\\phi$ is continuous and differentiable (referred to as holomorphic in mathematical parlance) which means any differentiable function represents the flow over some body. We just need to identify the function that represents the flowfield over the body of interest to us - an airfoil or a flat plate (airfoil with zero thickness). Lastly, the ubiquity with which this function appears in different areas of physics - electrostatics, gravitation etc. - means that aerodynamiscists would not be alone in their struggle to identify solution strategies for the Laplace's equation."

    "The NSE are generally all that an aerospace engineer needs for all their aerodynamics analyses needs - five field partial differential equations and three constitutive relations to solve for three space coordinates (Lagrangian)/velocity components (Eulerian), pressure, density, temperature, viscosity and thermal conductivity. fuselage [^RotorWake] Being field equations, the NSE can be solved if the boundary conditions of the domain of investigation are known. In case of boundaries that form the interface with another material - for e.g. the surface of a wing - additional conditions need to be imposed since NSE do not cover the physics at such interfaces. Examples include \"no slip\" boundary condition typically employed for flow over solid boundaries and \"no temperature jump\" in case of a temperature differential.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Since the momentum conservation equations are part of the NSE, Newton's 2nd is definitely involved when describing flow behavior. However, simply attributing lift generated by an airfoil, for e.g., to just Newton's 2nd law is not entirely accurate. There is an obvious cause and effect relation when one talks about Newton's 2nd law. Within a fluid, however, the motion of continuum parcels is influenced by the forces exerted and the forces exerted are in turn influenced by the motion of these parcels. For e.g., the momentum equation above can be viewed as a form of Newton's second law of motion F=mass x acceleration, except that the forcing terms on the RHS of the equation - the pressure gradient and the shear stresses - are themselves a function of the fluid velocity. The complex interaction between the three sets of forces - inertial, pressure and shear - is what gives fluid dynamics its richness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such implicit relations of relatively simple local physics (conservation laws) buried within the NSE make an intuitive foresight of what would happen in the global flowfield difficult. Below is an informal discussion of the mechanism by which airfoils generate lift to exemplify this. \n",
    "\n",
    "[^RotorWake]: When modelling rotor wake there is not much to be gained from solving the most complex form of the problem. For e.g., most rotorcraft (atleast conventional designs) don't fly faster than M=0.3 so right away density can be assumed to be constant without incurring much error. So can temperature and viscosity, and thermal conductivity is just zero. From the continuity and the momentum conservation equations, the problem then boils down to solving for the three velocity components and the pressure distribution. More on that later.  "

    "Due to the low magnitude of kinematic viscosity ($\\nu/\\rho$) of air, most flows of interest to an aerospace engineer occur at high Reynolds numbers (>$10^6$) and low angles of attack $\\alpha$. In such conditions the flow can be modelled reasonably well by dropping the viscous terms (i.e. assuming $\\nu=0$, limiting case of a viscous fluid).  Of course, one runs the risk of not being able to model effects of flow separation (which are viscous in nature), viscous drag etc. But the speed and ease of solving the fluid flow equations assuming $\\nu=0$ and the physicality of the results has led to a number of techniques to account for the viscous effects but without having to solve the full NSE equations. In fact for low Mach number flows, the fluid equations can be further simplified and yet be physically representative of the real flow field.  "

On the other hand, if you knew precisely the circulation around the cross-section of a wing or a blade, you could get the lift per unit span and the total lift would simply be an integral over all such sections over its span. Precise experiments carried out in the wind tunnel with wing sections {cite}`Add54`, where the flow velocities around these section have been measured, show that indeed the effect of an airfoil is to introduce a circulation around itself and that circulation everywhere else in the fluid domain is zero or close to zero.

This is a consequence of the viscosity of fluids in nature and the fact that they cannot turn around sharp corners (airfoil trailing edges are sharp enough). Since potential flow theory doesn't model viscosity, a condition needs to be mathematically enforced so that the resulting flow field obtained is physically correct (this is just one of those instances where observable physics guides a mathematical theory which would otherwise lead to a non-unique solution). This is achieved by enforcing what is called the Kutta condition.

When the fluid is set in motion there is vorticity due to the uniform fluid velocity, yet we now know (from the discussion aboce) that there would be a circulation set around the airfoil. The Kelvin's circulation theorem implies that a vorticity of opposite sign must be getting introduced in the fluid so that the net circulation around any closed contour, that includes the airfoil in it, must be zero.
